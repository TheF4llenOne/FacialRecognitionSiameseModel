# Facial Recognition Project
### Overview

This project implements a facial recognition system using a Siamese neural network architecture. The model is designed to differentiate between similar and dissimilar faces by learning a similarity function. This approach is particularly effective for tasks such as face verification and one-shot learning scenarios, where the model must recognize a face from a single example.
### Technologies Used

- TensorFlow: For building and training the neural network.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API to simplify the model creation process.
- OpenCV: For image processing and webcam integration.
- NumPy: For handling numerical operations on image data.
    Matplotlib: For visualizing the results.
    UUID: For generating unique identifiers for collected images.

### Features

    Data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
    Implementation of a Siamese network to compute similarity scores between pairs of images.
    Early stopping during training to prevent overfitting.
    Use of TensorFlow checkpoints for saving model and optimizer states.

### Future Work

    Anti-Spoofing Measures: Implement methods to detect and mitigate spoofing attacks (e.g., using photos or videos of the target) to enhance the security of the facial recognition system.
    Depth Mapping: Explore the use of depth information to improve accuracy, similar to technologies used in systems like Apple's Face ID, which utilizes depth sensors to create a 3D map of the face for secure recognition.

### Conclusion

This project lays the groundwork for a facial recognition system that can be further enhanced with additional features and improvements. By incorporating advanced techniques like anti-spoofing measures and depth mapping, the robustness and security of facial recognition systems can be significantly improved.
